    Although many nineteenth century philosophers developed the concepts of existentialism,
    it was the French writer Jean Paul Sartre who popularized it. His one act play, Huis Clos
    or No Exit, first produced in Paris in May, 19944, is the clearest example and metaphor
    for this philosophy. There are only four characters: the VALET, GARCIN, ESTELLE,
    and INEZ and the entire play takes place in a drawing room, Second Empire style, with a
    massive bronze ornament on the mantelpiece. However the piece contains essential germs
    of existentialist thought such as "Hell is other people."

    As you read the play,
    put yourself
    in that drawing room
    with two people
    you hate most in the world.
